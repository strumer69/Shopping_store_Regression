# how to have better clothing store

* we want to have a better clothing Store by using Linear Regression Solutions.
* a store in New York City that sells clothes. It sells clothes both online and advises customers in person. Customers come to the store and take part in an individual counseling session and then go home and make a purchase through their mobile phone or website.
* The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.



Congratulations! You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
