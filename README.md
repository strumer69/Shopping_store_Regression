# how to have better clothing store

* we want to have a better clothing Store by using Linear Regression Solutions.


* imagine we just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

* The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
